								<div class="text"><b>The Georgian military road</b>.Until the railroad from Batumi to Moscow was laid, 
								at the beginning of the 20th century, the road, crossing the ridge from Tbilisi to Vladikavkaz, 
								was considered the most important route that connected Georgia with countries north of the Caucasus.  
								For thousands of years, the mountainous, narrow and sloping gorge above chasms was guarded by tribes 
								loyal to the ancient kings of Georgia, and watchtowers were scattered along it. With the annexation 
								of Georgia to Russia at the beginning of the 19th century, the Russian army expanded the path, and from 
								then until today the road preserves the historical story of the path.</div>

								<div class="text">In the Meskhety Mountains lies the large, wooded and impressive <b>Borjomi Park</b>. 
								The park was founded in 1929, to protect the forests of the steep valley of Borjomi and serve as 
								a refuge for the Caucasian reindeer. Various paths have been marked in the reserve that allow travelers
								to walk along them for a few days in nature, almost without human interference. The reserve has a large 
								and rich variety of plants. The open part of the park is a beautiful garden, with a stream flowing through 
								it, a natural soda spring springs up in its heart, and crowds of Georgians come to walk in it, have fun with 
								their children and look at the old and ornate houses of the nobility, built near its gates.</div>

								<div class="text"><b>Tbilisi</b>, the city of hot springs, was used as a settlement already in the Neolithic period. 
								Since then, it has been occupied and destroyed dozens of times. Its position at the main junction of the Caucasus 
								roads made it not only the capital of many vicissitudes of Georgia but also the main city in the entire South Caucasus. 
								Every conqueror stamped his culture and customs on it, and every merchant caravan that camped there added something to
								the multi-national fabric that characterizes it. The city, today large and modern, lies in a river valley. It has a
								small ancient quarter, with narrow and winding alleys, walls and picturesque walled houses, 1500-year-old hot baths, 
								a museum of Georgian treasures and many small restaurants that serve the delicacies of the Caucasus.</div>
