			<h3>Hello,</h3>
			<p>My name is Veronika Sopov. I was born in Russia and made Aliah with my family in 2000.
			My whole life I wanted to travel and see the beauty this world gave us.
			When I met my husband he told me about some magical place he grew up in and promissed me 
			that we'll visit from his words "the best place on earth", pretty promising I would say..
			<p>Years passed and he finally surprised me with a trip to Georgia.
			We arrived to Batumi .At the first step I took from the plane, I felt it, all his stories
			threw the air.
			the view of the black sea on the one hand but when you turn around your breath taken away
			by the sights of the grandiose mountains.</p>
			<p>We treveled to Georgia four times before we decidet to stay a bit longer.
			For the last two year we are staying in Georgia, having the best time of our lives and
			keep traveling together to different countries.</p>
			<p>I really hope you will get inspired to travel and find usefull information for your
			next trip to Sakartvelo !</p>
